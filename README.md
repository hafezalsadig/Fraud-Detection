 ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection Machine Learning Model
This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning techniques** to detect fraudulent transactions.  
Financial fraud is a major challenge for banks and online businesses, and machine learning models can help identify unusual patterns that indicate fraud in real time.

The project covers the full **data science pipeline**:
 Data preprocessing and cleaning  
 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
 Model training and evaluation
 Saving and deploying the trained model
